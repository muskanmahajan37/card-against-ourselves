   # Yet another card game!
   
   2020 came with the great loss of one of the most enjoyable card games ever created, thus the project is meant to bring back old memories of farcicallity rocketing over the roof. Two clueless programmist over the course of next days will try to recreate game they have once lost. Hopefull as the project progresses, with the greater amount of people coming back to playing video games, they will be able to pick the game as the game of their choice to fight the sadness of being lockdown due to epidemic outbreak.
